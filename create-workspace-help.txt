create-workspace.bat - Create a new workspace in Visual Studio Code

Usage:
  create-workspace.bat [-h]

Options:
  -h  Display this help message

Description:
  This script creates a new workspace in Visual Studio Code. The script
  automatically detects the parent folder name as the workspace name and adds
  all folders within the directory to the workspace. It can be run by saving
  it as a `.bat` file in the root directory of the workspace and double-clicking
  on it.

  The script requires Visual Studio Code to be installed and added to the system's
  PATH environment variable.

Examples:
  To create a new workspace, save the `create-workspace.bat` file in the root
  directory of your workspace and double-click on it.

  To display this help message, run the script with the `-h` option:

    create-workspace.bat -h

Notes:
  - This script assumes that the code command is already in your system's PATH. If
    it's not, you'll need to add it manually or modify the script to include the
    full path to the code command.
  - The script ignores any folders named "other folder" in the root directory.
